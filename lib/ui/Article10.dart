The cavitary lesions post PTB serves as a good reservoir for fungal colonization and subsequent infection. Furthermore, the severe immunosuppression associated with HIV and TB co-infection is another predisposition. The inadequate capacity to investigate and manage fungal infection in PTB patients increases their morbidity and mortality. The study aimed to provide serological evidence of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) among PTB patients in Kenya. Towards this, we analysed 234 serum samples from patients presenting with persistent clinical features of PTB infections despite TB treatment in four referral hospitals.\n\n",
