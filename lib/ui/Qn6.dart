                          "1. Review the Technical Quality: Begin by assessing the technical quality of the CXR, including proper positioning, adequate exposure, and absence of artifacts or technical errors that may affect interpretation.\n"
                          "2. Evaluate the Lung Fields: Examine the lung fields bilaterally, looking for abnormalities such as infiltrates, opacities, masses, nodules, or areas of consolidation. Compare the density and symmetry of lung fields.\n"
                          "3. Assess the Lung Parenchyma: Evaluate the lung parenchyma for signs of pathology, including:\n"
                          "\t Pulmonary infiltrates: Indicative of pneumonia, tuberculosis, or other infectious processes.\n"
                          "\t Ground-glass opacities: Seen in interstitial lung diseases or pulmonary edema.\n"
                          "\t Consolidation: Indicates alveolar filling, often seen in pneumonia.\n"
                          "\t Nodules or masses: May suggest lung cancer, metastases, or granulomas.\n"
                          "\t Cavitation: Seen in advanced tuberculosis, fungal infections, or lung abscesses.\n"
                          "4. Inspect the Pleura: Assess the pleural spaces for signs of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pleural thickening. Look for blunting of the costophrenic angles or presence of pleural-based masses.\n"
                          "5. Check the Mediastinum: Evaluate the mediastinal structures, including the heart, great vessels, and lymph nodes. Look for mediastinal widening, lymphadenopathy, or masses.\n"
                          "6. Assess the Diaphragm: Examine the diaphragmatic contours for abnormalities, such as elevation, flattening, or eventration, which may indicate diaphragmatic pathology or subdiaphragmatic processes.\n"
                          "7. Review the Cardiac Silhouette: Evaluate the size and shape of the cardiac silhouette. Look for cardiomegaly, chamber enlargement, pericardial effusion, or signs of congestive heart failure.\n"
                          "8. Consider Clinical Context: Interpret CXR findings in the context of the patient's clinical history, symptoms, physical examination, and other diagnostic tests. Consultation with a radiologist or specialist may be necessary for complex cases or uncertain findings.\n"
                          "9. Document and Report Findings: Document CXR findings systematically and accurately in the medical record or radiology report. Include relevant clinical information, differential diagnoses, and recommendations for further evaluation or management.\n"
                          "10. Follow Up: Based on the CXR interpretation, initiate appropriate interventions, follow-up imaging studies, or referral to specialists for further evaluation or treatment as needed.\n\n"
                          "Interpreting CXR results requires a systematic approach, clinical correlation, and integration of findings with the patient's clinical presentation to arrive at an accurate diagnosis and formulate an optimal management plan.\n",
