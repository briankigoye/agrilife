While the coffee is still young, there is an area of land between the young coffee trees, which can be utilized to grow various crops, mainly food crops. Recommended intercrops in young coffee include bananas, green pepper, cabbages, tomatoes, soya-beans, groundnuts and the non-climbing Phaseolus beans. However, these must be confined to the central 2m of the inter-row, leaving a clear 0.5m between them and the coffee tree.",
